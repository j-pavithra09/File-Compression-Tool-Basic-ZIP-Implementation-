**1. Introduction**

> **1.1 Purpose**
>
> This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the functional and non-functional requirements for a basic File Compression Tool implemented in C/C++. The tool uses Huffman coding to reduce file size and supports compression and decompression of files through a simple command-line interface (CLI). This document is intended to guide design, implementation, and testing, and to serve as an evaluation reference for course instructors.
>
> **1.2 Scope**
>
> The system covers: reading an input file, calculating byte/character frequencies, constructing a Huffman tree, generating variable-length prefix codes, encoding data into a compressed bitstream, writing the metadata needed for decoding, and restoring the original file through decompression. The project is a basic, self-contained ZIP-like compression utility and does not aim to reproduce the full ZIP file-format specification or interoperate with standard ZIP archives.
>
> **1.3 Audience**
>
> Students, developers, testers, course instructors, and evaluators.
>
> **1.4 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations**

- Huffman Coding: A prefix-code algorithm that assigns shorter bit codes to more frequent symbols and longer codes to less frequent symbols.

- Compression: Reducing the number of bits required to represent file data.

- Decompression: Reconstructing the original file from compressed data.

- Bitstream: A sequence of bits used to store Huffman-coded data.

- Header / Metadata: Information stored with a compressed file (e.g. frequency table) that is needed to decode it.

- CLI: Command-Line Interface.

- ZIP-like: A basic compression utility inspired by common archive tools, without claiming full ZIP-format compatibility.

**2. Overall Description**

> **2.1 Product Perspective**
>
> The File Compression Tool is a standalone C/C++ desktop utility that operates on files available on the local file system. It has no dependency on an external server, network service, or database. Its main components are: file input/output handling, frequency analysis, Huffman-tree construction, code-table generation, bit-level encoding/decoding, compressed-file (header + bitstream) storage, and decompression/reconstruction.
>
> **2.2 Major Product Functions**

- Accept a file selected by the user for compression.

- Read the input file in binary mode without altering it.

- Calculate the frequency of each byte/symbol in the input.

- Construct a Huffman tree from the frequency table.

- Generate prefix-free Huffman codes for each symbol.

- Encode the input data into a compressed bitstream.

- Store the metadata/header required for decoding in the compressed output.

- Create a compressed output file with a defined extension (e.g. .huff).

- Accept a compressed file for decompression.

- Read and validate the compressed file's header/metadata.

- Reconstruct the Huffman decoding structure from stored metadata.

- Decode the bitstream and recreate the original byte sequence.

- Report basic compression statistics (original size, compressed size, ratio) to the user.

- Detect invalid paths, unreadable files, and invalid/corrupted compressed files.

- Avoid overwriting an existing output file unless explicitly confirmed by the user.

> **2.3 User Roles and Characteristics**
>
> User: A person with basic knowledge of files and command-line programs who supplies an input file and selects compression or decompression.
>
> Developer / Tester: Maintains the implementation and verifies functional, performance, reliability, and security requirements.
>
> Evaluator: Reviews whether the implementation satisfies the requirements and acceptance tests defined in this SRS.
>
> **2.4 Operating Environment**
>
> The system runs as a standalone C/C++ console program on a desktop/laptop operating system (Windows/Linux) with a standard C/C++ compiler (e.g. GCC/G++, MSVC) and standard file-system APIs. It must correctly handle binary files, not just text files.
>
> **2.5 Constraints**
>
> The project is limited to Huffman coding as the primary compression algorithm. It is a basic ZIP-like implementation and is not required to be compatible with standard ZIP archives. Available memory and storage depend on the host computer. Correct bit-level handling and lossless preservation of binary data are mandatory.

**3. External Interface Requirements**

> **3.1 User Interfaces**
>
> The primary interface is a command-line interface (CLI). The program shall provide clear command syntax/prompts for compression and decompression, input/output file paths, success messages, error messages, and basic compression statistics.
>
> **3.2 Hardware Interfaces**
>
> No dedicated hardware interface is required. The system uses the host computer's storage device and processor through standard operating-system facilities.
>
> **3.3 Software Interfaces**
>
> The tool uses standard C/C++ libraries and file I/O facilities only. No external server, database, or third-party service is required.
>
> **3.4 File / Communication Interfaces**
>
> Input and output are local files only; no network communication is required. The compressed file shall contain sufficient metadata (e.g. the frequency table or equivalent Huffman-tree information) to identify and decode the valid encoded bitstream.

**4. System Features (Detailed)**

> Each requirement below includes acceptance criteria and a reference test case. Requirement IDs follow FCT-F-###.
>
> **4.1 File Input and Frequency Analysis**
>
> Description: Accept and read the input file safely, then compute symbol frequencies used to build the Huffman tree.

**6. Security**

> **6.1 Security Objectives**

- Data Integrity: Ensure that compression and decompression do not unintentionally modify, lose, or corrupt the user's file data.

- Safe File Handling: Prevent unsafe handling of paths and output files, and fail safely when files or compressed metadata are invalid.

> **6.2 Security Requirements**

| **Req ID** | **Requirement (shall...)**                                                                                                                                     | **Type** | **Priority** | **Acceptance Criteria / Test Ref**                                                                           | **Comments**                                      |

TC-SEC-01 | First line of defense against corrupted archives. |
| FCT-SR-002 | The system shall report file-access failures and shall not treat a failed read or write operation as successful compression/decompression.                     | Security | High         | Simulated access failure produces an error status. TC-SEC-02                                                 | Also supports FCT-NF-006 (no silent corruption).  |

| FCT-SR-005 | The system shall reject incomplete or inconsistent compressed headers/metadata rather than attempting unsafe or undefined decoding.                            | Security | High         | Corrupted header test is rejected cleanly. TC-SEC-05                                                         | Prevents crashes/undefined behavior on bad input. |

**7. Quality Attributes & Acceptance Tests**

- Huffman tests: frequency calculation, tree construction, prefix-free codes, encoding and decoding correctness.

- Error tests: missing files, inaccessible files, invalid compressed files, truncated headers, and unwritable destinations.

- Performance tests: compare processing time and compressed size across representative file types.

- Integrity tests: compare original and decompressed files byte-for-byte.
